# Course Registration Managment
This is a software which is made for registering courses which is offered in a particular semester and creates a time table accordingly. It allows total of 12 credits to be registered per semester. The student is showed a time table and faculties which he/she can select every semeter. Once the course is registered it reflects in the time table immediately and student can check into the details of the registered course by clicking the *view details* button. This way the registration is done. This software is made in students point of view assuming the student nows his/her register number and password for login. 

## Motivation behind the Project
This project was developed for my course *Database Management Systems* in 4th semester of my college life. 

## Future work
I have to add a drop course module which allows the user to drop the course.

# Video demonstration of the project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/nYFu-ewd0sg)

## Note: Make sure to include mysql-connector in the project before running the application and look into the student table for authentication details. .
