# Course Registration Managment
This is a software which is made for registering courses which is offered in a particular semester and creates a time table accordingly. It allows total of 12 credits to be registered per semester. The student is showed a time table and faculties which he/she can select every semeter. Once the course is registered it reflects in the time table immediately and student can check into the details of the registered course by clicking the *view details* button. This way the registration is done.
